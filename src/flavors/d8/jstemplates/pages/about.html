<p>Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - propose ideas and vote for how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District. From   <strong>March 29th through April 6th, 2014</strong>, anyone who is a resident of the Council District and at least 16 years old will be able vote on which projects to fund. Browse the map to learn about the projects on the ballot, then click <a href="http://pbnyc.org/" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY. REAL PROJECTS. REAL POWER.">here</a> to find out when and where you can vote!</p>

<p>Each year, project ideas are collected in the fall, reviewed and developed over the winter, and voted on in the spring. The idea submission period will re-open next fall, but in the meantime you can still browse, support, and comment on the ideas that your neighbors proposed online last fall - and be sure to VOTE! <a href="http://pbnyc.org/" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY.
