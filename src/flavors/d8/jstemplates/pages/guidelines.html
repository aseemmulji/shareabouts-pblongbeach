<p>The idea submission period will re-open this fall, when you’ll be able to propose your ideas here or at a local assembly. Eligible ideas must be for "capital" projects: physical infrastructure for public benefit, such as park improvements or new technology for schools. “Expense" projects, such as afterschool programs or expanding bus service, are not eligible.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can view this past year’s winning projects and browse, support, and comment on other ideas that were proposed online.</p>
