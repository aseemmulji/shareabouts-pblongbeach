<h1>Real Money.</h1>
<h1>Real Projects.</h1>
<h1>Real Power.</h1>

<p>Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - directly decide how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District. Each year, people propose project ideas online and at local assemblies, develop the ideas into concrete proposals, and vote on which projects to fund.</p>

<p>The next cycle will begin this fall, but in the meantime you can view this past yearâ€™s winning projects and browse, support, and comment on other ideas that were proposed online.</p>
