<p>Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - directly decide how to spend at least $250k of the public budget.</p>

<p>If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map. Check out the guidelines to see what ideas can be funded.</p>

<p>Community members will then review your idea, alongside all the others, based on its feasibility, the need it would address, and the number of people it would benefit.</p>

<p>The top projects will be put on a ballot, and next Spring, all residents ages 14 and older in participating districts will vote on their top projects.</p>
