<h1>PB Long Beach</h1> 
<p>is an innovative democratic process that gives Long Beach District 9 residents the power to decide how to spend $250k in city capital funds in their district.</p>

<p>If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map. <a href="/page/guidelines">Check out the guidelines</a> to see what ideas can be funded.</p>

<p>Community members will then review your ideas, alongside all the others, and develop them into full proposals. In the Spring, residents, business owners, and non-profit representatives ages 14 and older in District 9 will vote on the top projects to be funded.</p>

<p>The top projects will be put on a ballot, and next Spring, all residents ages 14 and older in participating districts will vote on their top projects.</p>
